<h2> I. Base Rules </h2>

<h3> I.@. <a name="meta"/> Meta </h3>
<p> I.@.1. When rules in this document conflict, the later rule takes
  precedence. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.@.1.a. E.g. I.C.4 states that a captor may not capture, while
V.D.2 states that <span class="change">a player wearing Doc Arnold's Belt
of Many Places at Once may capture multiple times.</span> </p>
<p> I.@.2. The judges may choose to change the rules or add or remove stuff into
the game. Any such rules or stuff changes must be clearly explained before
the start of the game in which those changes are to be introduced. </p>

<h3> I.A. <a name="teams_territories"/> Teams and Territories </h3>
<p> I.A.1. The game consists of two teams, red and yellow. Team membership is
indicated by colored bands, worn on the upper arm or head, which must be
visible at all times. </p>
<p> I.A.2. Each team has a home territory. One team's is Wean, the other's is Doherty.
The teams should swap territories after each game. The territory is defined
as the space inside the building, with the doors closed, or as defined by
the judges in the case of ambiguity. Where there is a chamber between two
sets of doors, the chamber is included in the building. </p>
<p> I.A.3. Certain areas such as labs, clusters, and any normally
inaccessible or otherwise restricted areas are forbidden. No player may
enter these areas at any time during the game. </p>
<p> I.A.4. All areas which are neither a team's home territory nor
forbidden are neutral. There must always be at least ten feet of neutral
territory between opposing teams' home territories. </p>
<p> I.A.5. A player is considered to be in a team's territory if any
part of their body is in the team's territory. If a player is in no
team's territory, they are in neutral territory. Magic items have no
effect on players who are in neutral territory. </p>

<h3> I.B. <a name="players"/> Players </h3>
<p> I.B.1. A player is any person playing the game. </p>
<p> I.B.2. A teammate is a member of the same team. </p>
<p> I.B.3. An enemy is a player who is not a teammate. </p>
<p> I.B.4. A player may be normal, ethereal, captive, captor, prisoner,
interrogation victim, or stunned. </p>
<p> I.B.5. A normal player is in the default state described in these rules. </p>
<p> I.B.6. An ethereal player may not use, drop, or pick up magic items,
is not affected by magic items, may not capture, and may not be
captured. A player must use jazz hands to signal ethereality. </p>
<p> I.B.7. A captive is a player who has been captured (see ).
Captives may not move or touch enemy flags and may not use or drop
   magic items (except for the Ninja Potion; see ). </p>
<p> I.B.8. A captor is a player who has captured another player (see
). Captors must lead their captives to the jail (see ),
but are otherwise normal players. </p>
<p> I.B.9. A prisoner is a player who was a captive, but has touched the Glyph of Jail
(see ). </p>
<p> I.B.10. An interrogation victim is a prisoner who has been given truth serum
by the jailer (see ).  They may not use magic items, but otherwise act
identically to a prisoner except where specified. </p>
<p> I.B.11. A stunned player must immediately sit on the floor in the territory in which they were
stunned until the stun wears off. The time they are stunned is measured from
when they sit down, not when the stunning effect occurred. If they are captured
while stunned, they become unstunned. A player may not be stunned again while
stunned. Stunned players may not capture. </p>
<p> I.B.12. Only normal players and captors can be stunned. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.B.12.a. If John Mackey changes a player's major during the game, the player is
stunned for one minute. </p>

<h3> I.C. <a name="capture"/> Capture and Imprisonment </h3>
<p> I.C.1. If a player touches an enemy when both are in the first
player's home territory, they may choose to capture the enemy. At this
point, the enemy becomes a captive. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.C.1.a. As capture is optional, captors are encouraged to notify their
captives of this action ("Gotcha" is a good choice). </p>
<p> I.C.2. A player, when captured, must immediately drop any flags they are carrying at
the spot where they were captured. </p>
<p> I.C.3.  A captive or prisoner must give up any non-concealable items upon
request of the captor or a teammate of the captor. Concealable items need not
be given up unless the enemy asking for them knows that the player has the
item. </p>
<p> I.C.4.  A captor must lead their captive directly to their team's Glyph
of Jail (see ) at a reasonable speed. They cannot make any more
captures until their captive has entered jail by touching the Glyph of
Jail or another prisoner in the jail.  Once this
occurs, the captor is again a normal player, and the captive becomes a
prisoner. </p>
<p> I.C.5. If a captor is stunned, their captive becomes a normal player. </p>
<p> I.C.6. Prisoners may use magic items. </p>

<h3> I.D. <a name="jail"/> Jail </h3>
<p> I.D.1. Each team has a jail, designated by the Glyph of Jail. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.D.1.a. Whenever possible, the Glyph of Jail in Doherty will be placed on floor A,
near the staircase closest to the main lobby, and the Glyph of Jail in Wean
will be placed on floor 6, near room 6220 at the end of the 6200 corridor. </p>
<p> I.D.2. One player on each team may take on the role of jailer by
wearing the team's Jailer Fedora. The jailer is a normal player except
as described in the remainder of this section. The jailer may at any
time transfer the fedora to a teammate, who becomes jailer, or
remove it, leaving no jailer. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.D.2.a. In particular, if the jailer is captured or stunned, the jail
remains functional; prisoners are not released (although any interrogation
in progress is ended). </p>
<p> I.D.3. A player may not move the opposing team's fedora except to drop
it. </p>
<p> I.D.4. The prisoners must form one or more chains, with each player
touching the Glyph of Jail either directly or through a chain of other
prisoners. </p>
<p> I.D.5. If there is a jailer, they may relax the requirement to form chains. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.D.5.a. Typically, the jail is at the end of a hall, and prisoners are allowed to
sit around in the vicinity of the jail. </p>
<p> I.D.6.  Every fifteen minutes, starting from the beginning of play,
all prisoners are released from all jails. Released prisoners must
return to their home territories at reasonable speed, by the most
direct route. Prisoners released in this manner are ethereal until they
re-enter their home territories. </p>
<p> I.D.7. A player in a normal state not carrying a flag may touch a prisoner
in another team's jail. As long as freeing the prisoner does not break a
chain leading back to the jail, the prisoner is freed. Both players are
ethereal and must return to their home territory as after a jailbreak (see I.D.6);
they need not remain together. </p>
<p> I.D.8. The jailer has a supply of Truth Serum, which they may use by
poking a prisoner in the shoulder with a pinky finger. The prisoner
then becomes an interrogation victim. </p>
<p> I.D.9. The jailer may then ask the victim up to six yes/no
questions, and the victim may lie no more than once. The victim may
answer "I don't know" if they really don't know, but then the question
doesn't count against the six. </p>
<p> I.D.10. Upon completion of questioning, the victim is freed from jail
and must return to their home territory as after a jailbreak (see I.D.6).
Questioning is complete when the victim answers the sixth question, if
the jailer decides they are done with this victim, if the victim is
freed, at jailbreak, if there is no jailer, or if the jailer leaves line of
sight of the victim. </p>
<p> I.D.11. There may be at most one truth serum victim in each jail. </p>

<h3> I.E. <a name="setup"/> Initial Setup and Game Completion </h3>
<p> I.E.1. At the beginning of the game, there is a setup period of
fifteen minutes. This time should be used for the placement of flags
and glyphs, and distribution of magic items. No player may enter enemy
territory during this period. Magic items have no effect during this
time. </p>
<p> I.E.2. The game begins at the end of the set up period and ends after one
hour, or when there remains only one team with uncaptured flags. </p>

<h3> I.F. <a name="terms"/> Additional Terms </h3>
<p> I.F.1. Cooldown: This is a property of certain items. An item with
cooldown may not be activated again for one minute after its use. This
requirement may be suspended by the singing of a number of verses from
a song determined before the game begins; the item is then usable after
singing that song. </p>
<p> I.F.2.  Concealment: Potions may be concealed, meaning they need not
be visible. All other game items must be visible at all times. A
captive is not required to give up a concealed item unless their captor
asks for it specifically and knows that they have the item. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.F.2.a. Potions cannot be used while concealed. </p>
<p> I.F.3. Dispelling: A dispelled item has no magical effects. </p>

only be activated in enemy territory, must be dropped upon use, and may not
be picked up or moved when in enemy territory. </p>
<p> I.F.8. Whap: A player is whapped by a wand if it hits them at approximately the same
time the wand bearer shouts the key word. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.F.8.a. As wands are fairly soft, whapping a player on the head counts but is discouraged. </p>
<p> I.F.9. Key Words/Phrases: Some items have a key word or phrase used to
activate them.  This phrase must be said entirely in the territory where the
activation occurs, and the action occurs upon completion of the phrase. </p>
<p> I.F.10. Knowledge: knowledge of an opponent's concealable items, as referenced in
rules I.C.3 and I.F.2, means that they have not had a chance to dispose of
that item since the last time you saw it in their possession. </p>

<p> I.G.4. Any magic items a player is carrying are dispelled if they are
carrying a flag, and remain dispelled for one minute after the player
gives up the item or drops the flag. </p>
<p> I.G.5. Each flag will be assigned a point value at the beginning of the game by the
head judge. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.G.5.a. Judges may or may not inform the players of these values on a per-game basis. </p>
<p> I.G.6.  The winner of the game is the team with the most points. The point values of
each flag must be set such that the team with the most flags has the most points. </p>
<p class="subrulec1"> I.G.6.a. If the point system is set differently than specified in I.G.6, the players
must be informed of this fact before the set up of the game in which this takes place. </p>
<p> I.G.7. A player who brings a flag to the judges room earns for their
team the number of points associated with the flag. The flag is then
out of play for the remainder of the game. </p>
